### Test 1
### Task 2

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?


I mostly agree. Some kinds of punishments should be allowed to use since scolding or telling what is wrong might not be enough for children to understand. I believe some ways to punish them can give them chances to establish foundation of common sense to distinguish what is right or wrong. However I strongly believe any kinds of violence or punishment with anger should not be allowed.  

However, it is true that, in a conservative household, you often see punishment with violence. You can find a child crying while their parent is scolding with their anger. Furthermore, even teachers sometimes give them that sort of punishment. For example, snitching them with a ruler. Both are intended to show the furiousness with violence to their kids to persuade them to understand with fear. Similarly, antient governments around the world used to governed people in a brutal way with the same idea. The fact that the old fashion way to keep nation under control has disappeared in history suggest that it was not the best way. The reason why it is inappropriate is below. Children might stop doing wrong actions for fear of violence or just because they felt pressure, which potentially leads kinds away from creative or novel ideas. When I was in elementary school, I was scolded for not following a way to draw a picture for an 
assignment of art class. Then I blindly engaged with non sense rules ended up to craft or draw not innovative works. In addition, it does not necessary mean that they learned their fault even if they quit bad behavior. Furthermore, a person grew up in an environment with violence tend to control people physical power, which never works in the 21st century. 

On the contrary, not physical punishment is effective to teach goodness. I suggest some ways depending on characters of kids. For kids love snack, you can skip their snack for that day. By doing so, they can think why they cannot eat snacks, then might figure out what was wrong with their action. For kids love playing video game, parents can prohibit them from playing video games for a certain period of time. While they lost chance to play video games, they have opportunity and sufficient time to consider and reflect on their behavior.
