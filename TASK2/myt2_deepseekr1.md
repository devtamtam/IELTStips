<p>Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has provided their Task 2 essay and is asking for feedback. They previously shared their strategy for both Task 1 and Task 2, so I can see they're working on improving their IELTS writing. 

First, I'll read their essay to understand the content. The question is about whether university students should study other subjects or focus solely on their main qualification. The user supports the idea of studying multiple subjects, giving an example from their own experience with a project combining chemistry and engineering. 

Now, I need to evaluate their essay based on the IELTS criteria: Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. 

Starting with Task Achievement, the user presents both views and gives a clear opinion. They use a relevant example, which is good. However, the **counterargument **for focusing on the main subject could be more detailed. Maybe they could explain why some people think specializing is important, like job market competition.

For Coherence and Cohesion, the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The transitions between paragraphs are logical, but the conclusion feels a bit abrupt. They could summarize the main points more effectively.

Looking at Lexical Resource, there's some good vocabulary like "enrich their skills," "rapidly growing world," and "innovative actions." But there are areas for improvement. Phrases like "tackling other subjects" could be rephrased to "studying additional subjects" for more formality. Also, "make something novel" might be better as "create innovative solutions."

Grammatical Range and Accuracy has some issues. For example, "I believe tackling other subjects beside their main subjects enrich their skills so that I would like to support their idea." This has a subject-verb agreement error and is a bit unclear. They might say, "I believe that studying additional subjects alongside their main subjects enriches their skills, which is why I support this idea."

The user also uses "its obvious" which should be "it's obvious." There's a run-on sentence in the second paragraph that needs correcting. 

I should also suggest areas for improvement, like expanding the counterargument and enhancing vocabulary. Maybe they can use more formal language and vary their sentence structures for higher coherence.

Overall, the essay is good but needs refinement in grammar, vocabulary, and structure to score higher. I'll provide specific examples so they can see where to improve. Encouraging them to practice more and seek feedback is also important for their progress.</p>
</details>
<p>Here’s a detailed review of your Task 2 essay based on the IELTS Writing criteria: <strong>Task Achievement</strong>, <strong>Coherence and Cohesion</strong>, <strong>Lexical Resource</strong>, and <strong>Grammatical Range and Accuracy</strong>. I’ll also provide suggestions for improvement.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Task Achievement (8/9)</strong></h3>
<p>You have addressed the question by presenting both views and giving your own opinion. Your position is clear, and you have provided relevant examples from your own experience (e.g., the fuel cell project). However, the counterargument (about focusing on a single subject) is not fully developed. You could strengthen this by explaining why some people might prioritize specialization (e.g., job market competition, the need for deep expertise in certain fields). Additionally, the conclusion could be more concise and summarize the main points more effectively.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Coherence and Cohesion (7.5/9)</strong></h3>
<p>The essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The use of linking words like "however," "thus," and "therefore" helps maintain logical flow. However, some sentences are a bit wordy or repetitive, which can disrupt the flow. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"I believe tackling other subjects beside their main subjects **enrich** their skills so that I would like to support their idea."</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be rephrased for clarity and conciseness: "I believe that studying additional subjects alongside their main subjects enriches their skills, which is why I support this idea."</p>
<p>The conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could better summarize the main points.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Lexical Resource (7/9)</strong></h3>
<p>You have used some good vocabulary (e.g., "enrich their skills," "rapidly growing world," "innovative actions"). However, there are areas for improvement:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Word Choice</strong>: Some phrases are informal or repetitive. For example, "tackling other subjects" could be rephrased as "studying additional subjects" for a more formal tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Collocations</strong>: Phrases like "make something novel" could be replaced with more precise language, such as "create innovative solutions."</li>
    <li><strong>Variety</strong>: Use a wider range of academic vocabulary. For example, instead of "this project is the mixture of chemistry and engineering," you could say "this project combines principles from both chemistry and engineering."</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Grammatical Range and Accuracy (6.5/9)</strong></h3>
<p>Your essay demonstrates a good attempt at grammatical structures, but there are some errors that need attention:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Subject-Verb Agreement</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>"I believe tackling other subjects beside their main subjects enrich their skills..."</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The verb "enrich" should agree with the subject "tackling" (gerund). You could rephrase it as: "I believe that studying additional subjects alongside their main subjects enriches their skills."</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Punctuation and Sentence Structure</strong>:
        <ul>
             <li>"It is true that deep professional knowledge is required in this world. That is the very reason why experts focus on their specific domain."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These two sentences could be combined for better flow: "It is true that deep professional knowledge is required in this world, which is why experts focus on their specific domain."</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spelling and Typo</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>"its obvious" should be "it's obvious."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Suggestions for Improvement</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Expand the Counterargument</strong>: Dedicate more time to explaining why some people believe focusing on a single subject is important. For example, you could mention the importance of specialization in competitive job markets or the need for deep expertise in certain fields.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhance Vocabulary</strong>: Use more precise and formal language. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of "tackling other subjects," use "studying additional subjects."</li>
            <li>Instead of "make something novel," use "create innovative solutions."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Improve Sentence Structure</strong>: Vary your sentence structures to enhance readability. For example, combine short sentences where possible and avoid repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Formal Tone</strong>: Avoid informal phrases like "I would like to support their idea" and replace them with more formal alternatives, such as "I strongly support this idea."</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Final Score Estimate</strong></h3>
<p>Based on your essay, your score would likely fall in the <strong>Band 6.5 to 7</strong> range. With practice and attention to the areas mentioned above, you can aim for Band 7.5 or higher.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>Your essay is a good effort, and you’ve presented a clear opinion with relevant examples. To improve, focus on refining your grammar, expanding your vocabulary, and ensuring your essays are concise and well-structured. Keep practicing, and you’ll see improvement over time!</p>

# IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 - Revised Example

### Question

Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.

### Revised Answer

The question of whether university students should focus exclusively on their chosen major or explore other subjects is a pertinent one. While deep specialization undoubtedly fosters expertise in a particular field, the increasing demands of a globalised and interdisciplinary world necessitate a broader approach. This essay argues that a multidisciplinary curriculum, encompassing subjects beyond the core major, is crucial for developing valuable transferable skills and fostering innovation. This approach promotes a wider knowledge base, enhances critical thinking and fosters the creativity essential for future success.

A narrow focus on a single discipline, while undeniably valuable in cultivating expertise, often results in a less flexible skill set.  Students solely dedicated to their major may struggle to adapt to changing industry landscapes. Conversely, a multidisciplinary curriculum inherently broadens one's knowledge base, exposing students to diverse methodologies and perspectives. This exposure, by nature, fosters adaptability and a greater capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving. For instance, the development of a fuel cell application for electric vehicles seamlessly blends chemistry and engineering principles. This interdisciplinary endeavor necessitates a thorough understanding of electrochemical processes within the context of automotive design. By studying related subjects in detail, students gain a more comprehensive grasp of the problem and develop the analytical skills required to navigate such complexity.  Furthermore, a broader curriculum often encourages the exploration of diverse ideas, promoting creativity and the capacity to forge innovative solutions.  A student with a strong background in both chemistry and materials science, for example, might be better equipped to address the challenges of sustainable energy production.


While a focused approach to one's chosen field is undoubtedly valuable, it can limit the scope of a student's knowledge and potentially diminish adaptability.  Specialized expertise, crucial for a defined career path, relies on mastering core concepts within a particular discipline.  This detailed understanding allows for in-depth analysis and the ability to contribute effectively within a specific domain.  However, this specialized training often comes at the expense of a comprehensive understanding of interconnected fields, reducing the ability to problem-solve and innovate across disciplinary boundaries.

In conclusion, while specialization is essential for honing expertise, a comprehensive education, embracing a broader curriculum, ultimately provides a more robust skillset in today's rapidly evolving global landscape.  The development of transferable skills, enhanced critical thinking, and fostering of interdisciplinary approaches are vital for navigating the complexities of the future.  Therefore, encouraging university students to broaden their horizons by exploring other subjects provides them with the essential adaptability and creativity for long-term success.
